    <p>Filling:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup pitted and chopped dates, or to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup cold water, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or more to taste</li>

    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square
        baking dish
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine dates, water, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla extract in a
        saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until filling mixture forms a
        paste, about 5 minutes. <br />Add more water if filling gets too thick.

      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour in a bowl and rub margarine into flour using your hands
        until mixture resembles bread crumbs; stir in oats and 3/4 cup sugar.
        <br />Press 1/2 of the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Spoon
        filling over over crust, smoothing with the back of the spoon, leaving a
        thin border between the filling and the edge of the dish. <br />Sprinkle
        the remaining crumble mixture over filling.
